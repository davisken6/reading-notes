# Text Editors
**Text editors** are used by coders to edit their text as they type code. There are many different kinds of text editors, some common ones being: **Notepad** or **Text Edit**. These, however, are just the bare bone text editors.
Finding the right text editor is about trial and error and personal preference. Different text editors are used for different operating systems. Some are free, some cost money. ðŸ’²
A few important things to consider when choosing a text editor are: 
1. **Syntax Highlighting**, which colorizes the text 
2. **Themes**, which allow you to change the color of your background and series of color in text &
3. **Code Completion**, which helps by keeping a history of commands you have typed to save you time and also helps prevent mistakes like forgetting to close off your line of code.

 ## Linux
 **Linux** is an open source operating system and GUI(Graphical User Interface) like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS. Within Linux, you can enter different command codes to get to a certain part of your computer.
 Everything is a file under Linux and it is an extensionless system. Each part of your computer is technically a file that has a different use. Your screen is used to communicate the text and graphics, the keyboard is used for you to communicate text into the computer, the mouse is used to direct where you are headed on each page.
 Within Linux you will enter different **commands**. Some very common commands would be "ls" (lists your current location in the terminal), "cd" (used to move around the system), & "pwd" (Print Working Directory, tells you what your current working directory is).
 One thing to remember about Linux is that it **IS** case-sensitive. If you name a file something with a lower case p and type an upper case p, it reads this as two seperate files.
 If, for example, you wanted to open your "Family Photos", you would need to use quotes for this to be read as one file. Otherwise it would be read as two (1-Family, 2-Photos). 
 Linux has many short cuts and is an operating system that will become your friend once you get the hang of it.
