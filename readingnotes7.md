# Functions
**Functions** are fundamental to JavaScript. Functions consist of a key word followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters to the function (enclosed in parenthases and separated by commas), and the JavaScript statements that define the function (enclosed in curly brackets).

## Control Flow
The **control flow** is the order that a computer executes statements in a script. Unless otherwise specified, code is run in order from the first line in each file to the last line.

## Operators
An **operator** is a specific symbol used to perform operations on values and variables. Some operators are: 
<ul>
<li>Addition (+)</li>
<li>Subtraction (-)</li>
<li>Multiplication (*)</li>
<li>Exponentiation (**)</li>
<li>Division (/)</li>
<li>Modulus (%)</li>
<li>Increment (++)</li>
<li>Decrement (--)</li>
</ul>
