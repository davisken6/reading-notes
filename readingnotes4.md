# HTML
**HTML**(Hypertext Markup Language) is the code used to create the bare bones, or structure of a website. When coding with HTML, you can create paragraphs, put emphasis on certain words, add hyperlinks, insert images, and more. For starters, we use **opening** and **closing** tags in HTML. An example would be < p > first paragraph < /p >. For your paragraphs, p, you use the opening tag < p > and the closing tag < /p > to wrap your paragraph. The closing tag is the same as the opening, it just has a forward slash before the element, which in this case is p.

## Wire Frame
A **wire frame** is like a rough sketch of your project. This is how you brainstorm and get the basis of the project started. Before creating your website, you should draw out a wire frame. You can do this either with a pencil and paper, or you can use an online tool such as [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) or [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/). It is recommended to use a pencil and paper when first starting out, but it is personal preference. Your wire frame does **not** need to be pretty or super detailed. It is a rough **sketch**. Before starting your frame, first consider your audience and gather your needed information. Once this is together, start drawing out how you want your website to flow. You probably want some basics such as a table of contents so users can navigate your page, an "about me", images, and a heading. Add your details and you've got yourself a wire frame!
