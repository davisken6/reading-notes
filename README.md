## **Growth Mindset** 🧠
Growth mindset is the idea that intelligence and talents are not the basis of someone acquiring a skill. In order to achieve your goals you have to try hard and learn, not assume you are above having to. In order to maintain my growth mindset I will:
1. Persist through obstacles
2. Put in effort
3. Accept constructive criticism
