## Operators
JavaScript has **binary** operators, **unary** operators, and a **conditional** operator. 


A **binary operator** requires one operand before the operator and one operand after the operator. 


"operand1 operator operand2"



A **unary operator** requires only one operand either before or after the operator.

"operator operand"

or 

"operand operator"


**Assignment operators** asign a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple operand (=) assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. 


"a=b" means that "b" is equal to "a".



## Loops
**Loops** offer different ways to determine the beginning and end points of the loop. 
A **for** loop repeats until a specified condition is equal to "false".

for "([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
statement"

The **do...while** statement is similar to the "for" loop.

"do 
statment
while (condition);"
